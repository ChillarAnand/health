Setting up an ERP system is like starting your business all over again, but in the virtual
world. Thankfully its not as hard as the real thing and you get to do a trial too.

The important thing to note is that if you really want to take benefit out of this project, then you must take a step back and make sometime to do this right. This is usually not couple-of-hours after work kind of a project.
