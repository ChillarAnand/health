You can upload your opening stock in the system using Stock Reconciliation. Stock Reconciliation will update your stock for a given Item on a given date for a given Warehouse to the given quantity.

Stock Reconciliation will make a “difference entry” (the difference between the system stock and the actual stock in your file) for the Item.

Tip: Stock Reconciliation can also be used to update the “value” of an Item.

To make a Stock Reconciliation, go to:

> Stock > Stock Reconciliation > New Stock Reconciliation

and follow the steps mentioned on the page.
