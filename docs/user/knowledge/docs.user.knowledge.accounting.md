Accounting Entries

### Double Entry

This means that every accounting entry has two parts, one debit and one credit and must affect two separate accounts. If you add or deduct to one account, some other account somewhere else must also be affected. See the example below:

1. Company sells a laptop worth 50000 to Customer A and delivers that with an invoice.

As the company will receive a payment from customer, the customer is considered as an asset account. For booking income, company maintains an account called "Sales of Laptop". So, entries will be done in the following manner: 

<table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
        <tr class="active">
            <td style="text-align: center;">Account</td>
            <td style="text-align: center;">Debit</td>
            <td style="text-align: center;">Credit</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td style="text-align: center;">Customer A</td>
            <td style="text-align: center;">50000</td>
            <td style="text-align: center;"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="text-align: center;">Sales of Laptop</td>
            <td style="text-align: center;"></td>
            <td style="text-align: center;">50000</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Customer A has made the payment, so customer balance should decreased based on the paid amount, which will increase "Cash" balance.

    <thead>
        <tr class="active">
            <td style="text-align: center;">Account</td>
            <td style="text-align: center;">Debit</td>
            <td style="text-align: center;">Credit</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td style="text-align: center;">Customer A</td>
            <td style="text-align: center;"></td>
            <td style="text-align: center;">50000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="text-align: center;">Cash</td>
            <td style="text-align: center;">50000</td>
            <td style="text-align: center;"></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
