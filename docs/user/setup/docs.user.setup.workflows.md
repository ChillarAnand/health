In order to allow multiple people to submit  multiple requests, for approvals, by multiple users, ERPNext requires you to fill the workflow conditions.
ERPNext tracks the multiple permissions before submission.

For Example, Multiple users may wish to apply for a leave. This request will be sent to the HR department. The HR department will either reject or approve. Once this process is completed, the user's Manager(leave approver) will get an indication that the HR department has accepted or rejected. Depending on the Managers approving authority, he will either override the HR request or continue to endorse it. Accordingly,the user will get his approval or rejected status. 

To make this Workflow and transition rules go to :

 > Setup > Workflow > New Workflow
