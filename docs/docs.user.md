This manual covers all the major processes in setting up and using ERPNext. The manual is written in a way that the user can manage a self-implementation of the ERP. We recommend that the manual be read first before starting implementation.

- The first section covers the ERPNext setup process where the foundations and masters are introduced. 
- The second section covers how to manage core operations like Sales, Purchase, Inventory, Accounting, Manufacturing and Projects using ERPNext. 
- The third section covers administrative processes like managing Human Resources, Support and Maintenance and setting up a website from within ERPNext. 
- The next section covers using the various collaborative tools and reports that help you co-ordinate work with your colleagues. 
- The final section covers customization and advanced configuration options.

ERPNext is a work in progress and we anticipate that there will be a lot of additions and improvements to the product and the manual.
